# Quantum_Crypto

Recreation of four different cryptography algorithms to research the differences in performance and security. All four of these will be able to encrypt and decrypt a simple message for testing purposes. Slides for each algorithm included.

-RSA: First, took a look at the popular RSA algorithm from a classical sense to compare to the other three which are quantum computing algorithms. RSA involves a public and private key where the public key is known and a private key is sent between the two parties in order to encrpyt and decrypt the message. A hacker would have trouble cracking this classically because it would involve the factoring or very large prime numbers, which is compututaionally hard for classical computers.
